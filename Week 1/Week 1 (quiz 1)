Question 1:-
    A computer program is said to learn from experience E with
    respect to some task T and some performance measure P if its
    performance on T, as measured by P, improves with experience E.
    Suppose we feed a learning algorithm a lot of historical weather
    data, and have it learn to predict weather. What would be a
    reasonable choice for P?
    
Answer:- The probablity of it correctly predicting a future date's weather


Question 2:-
    The amount of rain that falls in a day is usually measured in
    either millimeters (mm) or inches. Suppose you use a learning
    algorithm to predict how much rain will fall tomorrow.
    Would you treat this as a classification or a regression problem?
    
Answer:- regression

Question 3:-
    Suppose you are working on stock market prediction, Typically
    tens of millions of shares of Microsoft stock are traded
    (i.e., bought/sold) each day. You would like to predict the
    number of Microsoft shares that will be traded tomorrow.
    Would you treat this as a classification or a regression problem?
    
Answer:-Regression

Question 4:-
    Some of the problems below are best adressed using a supervised learning 
    algorithum, and other with an unsupervised learning algorithum. Which of 
    the following would you apply supervised learning to?(select all that apply)
    In each case,assume some appropriate data set is available for your algorithum 
    1o learn from.
    
Answer :- Examine a large no of emails that are known to be spam email, discover if there is any subtypes of spam mail

Question 5:-
    Which of these is a reasonable definition of machine learning?
    
Answer :- Machine learning a feild of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed
